## 4-bit Didactic Microcomputer ##

<!-- This is a comment -->

The hardware is finished and working.  
However, it needs exhaustive testing over a long period to see if the hardware will fail when operating at full speed. It implies that if the hardware fails, the maximum clock speed must be reduced, for example, to 2.5 MHz.  

This project was developed mainly for educational purposes.  

I hope it will be a good learning platform for anyone who likes electronics, computers and programming.  

Since my first attempts, many efforts have been made to make this project real.  

It is aimed at students, enthusiasts, hackers, professors and anyone who wants to understand or improve their knowledge of electronics and learn how a simple computer works. In addition, it is also an attempt to rescue the story about the beginning of the development of integrated circuits and computers on a single chip, to demonstrate the capabilities that these machines had at that time.  

It is a fully open-source hardware and software project that can be built at home.  Only the printed circuit board (PCB) needs to be produced by some company.  

For the next steps, an important thing is to make good documentation for MikroLeo!

### Instruction Set Description ### 

**LDI - Load with Immediate**  
Description: Loads the operand value into a register.  
Registers: ACC, RA, RB or RC  
Operation: Register <─ Operand

| <sub>Instruction Word</sub> | <sub>ROMH</sub> |      <sub>Instruction</sub>     | <sub>Affected Flags</sub> |
|------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| 0x00Xn           |0x00                   | LDI ACC,n            |ZF              |
| 0x10Xn           |0x10                   | LDI RA,n             |-               |
| 0x20Xn           |0x20                   | LDI RB,n             |-               |
| 0x30Xn           |0x30                   | LDI RC,n             |-               |

Note:  
The operand (immediate) is represented by the letter "n".  
'X' (in capital letter) means it doesn't matter.  
'x' (in lowercase) is used to represent a hexadecimal number.

# Basic Documentation #

**- MikroLeo has four Registers**  
`ACC` - Accumulator (4 bit) - Stores the result of logical and arithmetic operations. Moreover, ACC stores data that is read from or written to RAM.  
`RA` - 4 bit General purpose Register (also used for addressing).  
`RB` - 4 bit General purpose Register (also used for addressing).  
`RC` - 4 bit Special purpose Register used for addressing.  

**- Two Flags**  
Flags can only be checked by conditional jump instructions (JPC and JPZ).  

`CF` - Carry Flag - It is Set (CF=1) by ADD Instruction if it produces a carry or by SUB/CMP instruction if it results in a borrow.  
`ZF` - Zero Flag - It is affected by operations that modify the contents of the ACC and by CMP instruction. It is Set (ZF=1) if the result of the last operation was zero.    

Example of how CF and ZF are Set:  
```asm
LDI ACC,1    ;Load the operand value into the ACC accumulator.
ADD ACC,0xF  ;Performs the addition between the accumulator and the operand and stores the
             ;result in the accumulator.
```
This code does it,
```
   0001
+  1111
-------  
 1 0000  
 ↓   ↓  
CF  ACC

As the value zero is written to ACC, ZF=1.
```

**- Addressing Modes**  

<ins> *Immediate* </ins>  

In immediate addressing, the operand (n) is contained in the lower nibble of the instruction (b3:b0), and it is denoted by Operand, LAddr or OPR.  

Example 1:  
```asm
LDI ACC,1    ;Load the operand value into the ACC accumulator.
```
Example 2:  
```asm
LDI ACC,0xA  
```
Example 3:
```asm
NAND ACC,0   ;Performs the NAND operation between the accumulator and the operand value and
             ;stores the result in the accumulator.
```
Example 4:
```asm
OUTA 0xF     ;Sends the operand value to the OUTA output port.
```
Example 5:
```asm
CMP ACC,0    ;Performs the comparison between the accumulator and the operand.
```
Example 6:
```asm
SUB ACC,1    ;Performs the subtraction between the accumulator and the operand and stores
             ;the result in the accumulator.
```
Example 7:
```asm
ADD ACC,5    ;Performs the addition between the accumulator and the operand and stores the
             ;result in the accumulator.
```

<ins> *Register Direct* </ins>  

In this mode, the operand must be one of the four registers (ACC, RC, RB, RA). Thus, the contents of the lower and medium nibble of the instruction (MAdrr, b7:b4 and LAddr, b3:b0) do not matter. Note that in the LDR instruction, the operand (ACC) is implied. LDR stands for load the Register Rx with ACC, being x={A,B,C}. In the LDA instruction, the operand must be one of the three registers (RC, RB, RA). LDA stands for load the accumulator with one of Rx Registers. Note that in register direct addressing mode, data can be read from or written to a register.  

Example 1:  
```asm
LDR RA     ;Loads the value of the ACC accumulator into the RA register.
```
Example 2:  
```asm
LDR RB     ;Loads the value of the ACC accumulator into the RB register.
```
Example 3: 
```asm
LDA RA     ;Loads the value from the RA Register into the ACC accumulator.
```
Example 4: 
```asm
LDA RC     ;Loads the value from the RC Register into the accumulator ACC.
```

<ins> *Register Indirect + Absolute* </ins>

In this addressing mode, the `RC` Register points to the high address (b11:b8). The medium (MAddr) and low (LAddr) nibble of the instruction, point to the medium and low address, respectively.  

The final address is composed by `RC:MAddr:LAddr`.  

For example, if:  
```
RC = 3  
MAddr = 2  
LAddr = 1  
```
The address to be accessed is 321h.  
In the MikroLeo python assembler, absolute addresses (`MAddr:LAddr`) are indicated by an @.

Example 1:
```asm
LDI RC,1       ;Loads the operand value into the RC Register.
OUTA @0xF4     ;Sends the contents of the RAM address pointed to by RC:MAddr:LAddr to output
               ;port A, in this case, the RAM address is RC:MAddr:LAddr = 1F4h.
```
Example 2:
```asm
LDI RC,3       ;Loads the operand value into the RC Register.
ADD ACC,@0xFC  ;Sum the contents of the RAM address pointed to by RC:MAddr:LAddr with ACC
               ;and stores it in ACC. In this case, the RAM address is RC:MAddr:LAddr = 3FCh.
```
Example 3:  
```asm
LDI RC,1       ;Loads the operand value into the RC Register.
JPI @0x23      ;Jumps to the specified label. In this case, the label address is
               ;RC:MAddr:LAddr = 123h.
```
Example 4:  
```asm
LDI RC,2       ;Loads the operand value into the RC Register.
CMP ACC,0      ;Compares the contents of ACC with the operand. Is ACC equal to 0?
JPZ @0x34      ;Jumps to the specified label if ZF=1 (ACC = 0). In this case, the label
               ;address is PCH:MAddr:LAddr = PCH:34h. JPZ does not affect PCH.
```
Example 5:  
```asm
LOOP:  
  LDI RC,3       ;Loads the operand value into the RC Register.
  STW @0x21,ACC  ;Stores the contents of the accumulator in the RAM address pointed by
                 ;RC:MAddr:LAddr, in this case, the RAM address is RC:MAddr:LAddr = 321h.
  LDI RC,>LOOP   ;Gets the address of the label, as this code changes the contents of the
                 ;Register RC.
  JPI LOOP       ;Jumps to the specified label.
```
Example 6:  
```asm

  CMP ACC,@0x32  ;Compares the contents of ACC with the contents of the RAM address
                 ;pointed by RC in this case, the RAM address is RC:MAddr:LAddr = 432h.

  JPZ LOOP       ;Jumps to the specified label if ZF=1 (ACC = @432h).
```

<ins> *Register Indirect* </ins>

In this addressing mode, the `RC` Register points to the high address (b11:b8). Likewise, the `RB` Register points to the medium Address (MA) while the `RA` Register points to the low Address (LA). Note that the contents of the lower and medium nibble of the instruction (MAddr, b7:b4 and LAddr, b3:b0) do not matter.  

The final address is composed by `RC:RB:RA`.  

For example, if:  
```Thus, the contents of the lower and medium nibble of the instruction (b7:b4, b3:b0) do
not matter.
RC = 3  
RB = 2  
RA = 1  
```
The address to be accessed is 321h.  
In MikroLeo's python assembler, indirect register addresses (`RC`:`RB`:`RA`) are indicated by an @R.

Example 1:
```asm
LDI RC,1       ;Loads the operand value into the RC Register.
LDI RB,0xF
LDI RA,4
OUTA @R        ;Sends the contents of the RAM address pointed to by RC:RB:RA to output
               ;port A,
               ;in this case, the RAM address is RC:RB:RA = 1F4h.
```
Example 2:
```asm
LDI RC,3       ;Loads the operand value into the RC Register.
LDI RB,0xF
LDI RA,0xC
ADD ACC,@R     ;Sum the contents of the RAM address pointed to by RC:RB:RA with ACC
               ;and stores it in ACC. In this case, the RAM address is RC:RB:RA = 3FCh.
```
Example 3:  
```asm
LDI RC,1       ;Loads the operand value into the RC Register.
LDI RB,2
LDI RA,3
JPI @R         ;Jumps to the specified label. In this case, the label address is
               ;RC:RB:RA = 123h.
```
Example 4:  
```asm
LDI RC,2       ;Loads the operand value into the RC Register.
LDI RB,3
LDI RA,4
CMP ACC,0      ;Compares the contents of ACC with the operand. Is ACC equal to 0?
JPZ @R         ;Jumps to the specified label if ZF=1 (ACC = 0). In this case, the
               ;label address is PCH:RB:RA = PCH:34h. JPZ does not affect PCH.
```
Example 5:  
```asm
LOOP:  
  LDI RC,3       ;Loads the operand value into the RC Register.
  LDI RB,2
  LDI RA,1
  STW @R,ACC     ;Stores the contents of the accumulator in the RAM address pointed by
                 ;RC:RB:RA, in this case, the RAM address is RC:RB:RA = 321h.
  LDI RC,>LOOP   ;Gets the address of the label, as this code changes the contents of
                 ;the Register RC.
  JPI LOOP       ;Jumps to the specified label.
```
Example 6:  
```asm
LOOP:  
  LDI RC,3       ;Loads the operand value into the RC Register.
  LDI RB,2
  LDI RA,1
  LDW ACC,@R     ;Loads the contents of the RAM address pointed by RC:RB:RA in the
                 ;accumulator, in this case, the RAM address is RC:RB:RA = 321h.
  LDI RC,>LOOP   ;Gets the address of the label, as this code changes the contents of
                 ;the Register RC.
  JPI LOOP
```
Example 7:  
```asm
LOOP:  
  LDI RC,4       ;Loads the operand value into the RC Register.
  LDI RB,3
  LDI RA,2
  CMP ACC,@R     ;Compares the contents of ACC with the contents of the RAM address
                 ;pointed by RC in this case, the RAM address is RC:RB:RA = 432h.
                 ;Is ACC equal to @432h?
  JPZ LOOP       ;Jumps to the specified label if ZF=1 (ACC = @432h).

# History and Motivation #
Since the time I took an 8086 assembly language programming course and took digital electronics and microprocessors classes in college, this project has been something I've always wanted to do. I'm fascinated by electronics, computers and programming!

The project started in 2020, and the first usable version was completed on April 20, 2020.  

Initially, the development of the project used the [Logisim-Evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution), and later it was migrated to the [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital).
