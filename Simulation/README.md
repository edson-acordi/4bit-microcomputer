This folder holds the ***simulation file for MikroLeo*** to be used in the **Digital software** (developed by Helmut Neemann).  

The Digital software can be downloaded at https://github.com/hneemann/Digital/releases/download/v0.29/Digital.zip

Note: For some reason, the author of Digital changed something in the source code after v0.29 that does not work with the MikroLeo_v0.19.dig.
However, MikroLeo_v0.19.dig works fine with Digital v0.29 (and problably with earlier version).
